# Security Implementation Notes

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. URL Validation and Sanitization
- **Location**: `src/utils/security.ts`
- **Purpose**: Prevents XSS attacks through malicious URLs
- **Features**:
  - Blocks dangerous protocols (javascript:, data:, etc.)
  - Validates URL format and structure
  - Prevents access to private/local IP ranges
  - Sanitizes text content to remove HTML and dangerous characters

### 2. Input Sanitization
- **Components**: FeedWidget, TickerTape, FeedConfigDialog
- **Purpose**: Prevents injection attacks through RSS content
- **Implementation**:
  - All RSS feed content is sanitized before display
  - HTML tags are stripped from content
  - Event handlers and javascript: protocols are removed

### 3. Safe Link Handling
- **Feature**: Links are validated before rendering
- **Behavior**: 
  - Safe links display normally with external link icon
  - Unsafe links are blocked and marked with shield icon
  - Users are warned about blocked unsafe content

### 4. Feed URL Validation
- **Location**: Feed configuration dialog
- **Purpose**: Prevents malicious feed URLs from being added
- **Checks**:
  - Valid HTTP/HTTPS protocols only
  - No private/local network access
  - Proper URL format validation

## Security Warnings and Known Issues

### ⚠️ CORS Proxy Dependency
- **Issue**: Using public CORS proxy (whateverorigin.org)
- **Risk**: Third-party dependency, potential data interception
- **Recommendation**: Implement own backend proxy service
- **Mitigation**: All content is sanitized after fetching

### ⚠️ Third-Party Script
- **Issue**: Required script from cdn.gpteng.co
- **Risk**: Supply chain attack vector
- **Recommendation**: Host scripts locally if possible
- **Current**: Script is required for platform functionality

## Recommended Server-Side Headers

The following security headers should be implemented on the server:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.gpteng.co; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://whateverorigin.org; frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test with malicious URLs (javascript:, data:, etc.)
- Verify HTML content is sanitized
- Check that private IP feeds are rejected
- Confirm unsafe links are blocked

### Automated Testing
- Consider implementing security-focused unit tests
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Monitor for new security advisories

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Implementation**: Replace CORS proxy with controlled backend
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement strict CSP headers
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add request rate limiting for feed fetching
4. **Audit Logging**: Log security events and blocked content
5. **Content Validation**: Additional validation for RSS content structure
